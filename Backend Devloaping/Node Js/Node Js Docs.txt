1 =>  What is Node.js?
     =>  Node.js is an open source server environment
         Node.js is free
         Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
         Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

   (*Defination*)
         Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling them to build scalable and efficient network applications.Node incorporates the V8 JavaScript engine, the same one used in Google Chrome and other browsers.
It is written in C++ and can run on macOS, Linux, Windows and other systems. The engine parses and executes JavaScript code. It can operate independently of a browser environment, either embedded in a C++ application or implemented as a standalone program. The V8 engine compiles JavaScript internally, using just-in-time (JIT) processes to speed up execution.
